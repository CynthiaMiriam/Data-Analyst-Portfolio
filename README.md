# Data Analytics Portfolio

# About
I am Cynthia Nakachwa and I have a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data. I have enjoyed exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether individually or through team work. I am driven by the ability to use statistical analysis to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase my capabilities, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics

# Portfolio projects
In this section, i will list the data analytics project briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases

## Bank Marketing Strategy
Code: [What factors can be analysed to determine the success of the banks marketing strategy](https://github.com/CynthiaMiriam/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Bank%20marketing%20analysis.ipynb)

Overview:
*  Previous - shows whether the last campaign was successful with the consumer.
*  march & may - when the last call was made to the specific customer
*  credit - shows if the customer had enogh credit to avoid defaulting
*  duration - the time since the last contact with the customer

Skills: data cleaning, logistic regression, data visualization\
Technology: python libraries(pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn)

Results: The model to determing the success of a bank marketing strategy using the above factors was 86.04%

## Used cars
code: [Predicting the price of used cars depending on its specifications. ](https://github.com/CynthiaMiriam/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/used%20cars.ipynb)

Overview:
Predicting the price of used cars depending on its specifications. \
Problem statement\
Predict the price of a used car depending on its specifications using statistical and machine learning techniques. This involves analyzing key features that influence the price and building a model.

Preprocessing
* Data cleaning such as handling missing variables, outliers. Exploratory data analysis to identify the existing trends and patterns of the dataset using scatterplot. Checking and relaxing the ordinary least square assumptions. 
* Declare the inputs (Mileage, EngineV, (Body, Brand, Engine Type and Registration categories)) and targets (price).  Then scale your data to fix the difference in magnitude of the variables.
* Create a regression algorithm and find the weights and biases. Then test the model.

Skills: data cleaning, linear regression, data visualisation\
Technology: python libraries(pandas, numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, statsmodels)

Results:
* 	A positive weight on EngineV shows that as it increases so does the price respectively.
* 	A negative weight on Mileage shows that as it increases, the price decreases.
*  A positive weight shows that the respective brand is more expensive than the Audi.
*  A negative weight shows that the respective brand is less expensive than the Audi.
*  A positive weight shows that the respective body is more expensive than the crossover.
*  A negative weight shows that the respective body is less expensive than the crossover.
*  A positive weight shows that the respective Engine Type is more expensive than the Diesel.
*  A negative weight shows that the respective Engine Type is less expensive than the Diesel.
*  A positive weight shows that the respective Registration ‘yes’ is more expensive than the benchmark ‘no’.



## Business case
code: [The organisation seeks to ensure data accuracy and alignment with business policies regarding employees records and salary structures](https://github.com/CynthiaMiriam/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Business%20case.sql)

Overview: By analyzing trends in salaries and department changes, as well as validating key data fields such as hire date, the company can improve decision-making, compliance and workforce planning.

Problem statement
* 	Understanding how employees’ salaries evolved overtime.
*  Tracking the most recent department where the employee is working.
*  Ensuring that the hire dates entered into the system are valid and not set to future dates.

Skills: Joins, Triggers, Procedures, Functions.\
Technology: SQL

Results:
* 	Visualization salary trends over time
* Tracking employee departments
* 	Ensuring data integrity
